# BDD Test Generator

## Overview
A test automation framework that leverages LLM (Large Language Models) to generate Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests from Jira and Notion tickets. The system automatically creates Celery-compatible tests that map to both functional and non-functional requirements.

## Features (Planned)
- Automated BDD test generation from:
  - Jira tickets
  - Notion documents
- LLM-powered test generation
  - Automatic conversion of requirements to test code
  - Intelligent test case creation based on ticket context
  - Test naming convention matching ticket IDs
- Integration of functional and non-functional requirements
- Celery-based test execution
- Automated documentation generation from:
  - Source tickets
  - Test execution results

## How It Works
1. **Input Sources**
   - Jira epics and associated tickets
   - Notion documents
   - Requirements mapping (functional & non-functional)

2. **LLM Test Generation**
   - Analyzes ticket content using LLM
   - Extracts testable requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Generates Celery test files with:
     - Test names matching ticket IDs (e.g., `JIRA-123.py`)
     - BDD-style test structure
     - Appropriate assertions and validations
   - Maps non-functional requirements to test scenarios

3. **Test Structure**
   ```python
   # Example generated test structure
   @celery_task
   def test_TICKET_123():
       """
       Test generated for TICKET-123: User Authentication Flow
       
       Functional Requirements:
       - User can log in with valid credentials
       - System validates input format
       """
       # Test implementation generated by LLM
   ```

4. **Test Execution**
   - Runs tests using Celery
   - Tracks pass/fail status
   - Collects test execution metrics
   - Maps results back to original tickets

5. **Documentation**
   - Automatically generates documentation from:
     - Original ticket content
     - Generated test cases
     - Test execution results
     - Requirements coverage analysis

## Technical Architecture
- **Input Processing**
  - Jira/Notion API integration
  - Requirement parser
  - LLM context preparation

- **Test Generation Engine**
  - LLM integration layer
  - Test template system
  - Celery task generator
  - Naming convention manager

- **Execution Framework**
  - Celery worker configuration
  - Test runner
  - Result collector
  - Reporting system

## Installation
(To be added)

## Usage
Example workflow:
1. Configure ticket source (Jira/Notion)
2. Define functional requirements in tickets
3. System automatically:
   - Fetches ticket content
   - Generates Celery tests via LLM
   - Names tests according to ticket IDs
   - Creates test documentation
4. Execute tests through Celery
5. View results and generated documentation
